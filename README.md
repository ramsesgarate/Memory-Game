# Memory Game JS Vanilla

Memory game, as the name implies is a game where you have to locate the pair of each card, for this you have to memorize what is the location of each one and uncover until there are no more

This game is a replica of @memory from @taniasrascia, I decided to do this tutorial to improve my JavaScript Vanilla skills. (You can read the full tutorial on how to make this memory game here)

At the end of his article he indicates that they can agree on things like a failed attempt counter, among other things, so decide to take this to another level and add other things like, a failed attempt counter, a hit counter, a button to restart the game, a congratulatory view for completing the game, and a stopwatch indicating how long it has been since you started the game.
