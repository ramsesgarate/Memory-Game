# Memory Game JS Vanilla

Memory game, as the name implies is a game where you have to locate the pair of each card, for this you have to memorize what is the location of each one and uncover until there are no more.

This game is a replica of memory from [@taniarascia](https://github.com/taniarascia), I decided to do this tutorial to improve my JavaScript Vanilla skills. [Read the tutorial of Tania](https://www.taniarascia.com/how-to-create-a-memory-game-super-mario-with-plain-javascript/)

I decided to extend the game a little more to add certain features, which I will detail throughout the post.

## Goals

The game will start when you press the `Start Game` button, when you start you will have two counters that will indicate the number of hits and failed attempts, once the game starts, a timer will start running that indicates the time that has elapsed since you started the game and It will have a button to restart the game at any time.

Click on the demo below to understand what we will create.

[See Demo](https://ramsesgarate.github.io/memory-game/)

### Planning

I am going to divide this second part into the following parts.

Start the game with the `Start Game` button
Increasing the counters is successful or a failed attempt.
Add a button to restart the game.
Add a counter.

### Instructions

Coming soon
